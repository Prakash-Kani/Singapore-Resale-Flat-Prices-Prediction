# Singapore Resale Flat Prices Prediction
___

## **Problem Statement**
___

The objective of this project is to create a machine learning model to predict the resale prices of Housing Development Board (HDB) flats in Singapore. The model should be able to accurately estimate the resale price of a flat based on its various characteristics, such as location, flat type, floor area, and lease duration. This will assist both potential buyers and sellers in making informed decisions about the purchase or sale of a flat.

## Key Challenges

1. **Market Competitiveness:** The Singapore resale flat market is dynamic and highly competitive, making it crucial to develop a predictive model that can adapt to changing market conditions.

2. **Multifaceted Factors:** Numerous factors influence resale prices, such as location-based demand, flat specifications, and lease details. The model must effectively capture and weigh these factors for accurate predictions.

3. **User-Friendly Application:** The deployment of the predictive model involves creating a user-friendly web application accessible to a wide range of users. The interface should be intuitive and provide transparent insights into the estimated resale prices.


## Project Scope
___

The project will encompass the following key aspects:

1. **Data Collection:**
   - **Objective:** Gather comprehensive historical data on resale flat transactions in Singapore.
   - **Rationale:** To ensure the robust training and validation of the machine learning model, a thorough collection of diverse and relevant historical data is essential.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**

   - **Rationale:** High-quality data is crucial for model accuracy. This step involves handling missing values, outliers, and ensuring uniformity in data format and structure.

3. **Model Development:**
   - **Objective:** Employ machine learning techniques with a focus on model interpretability and accuracy.
   - **Rationale:** Utilize advanced algorithms to train a model that accurately predicts resale flat prices, taking into account various influencing factors.

4. **Web Application Deployment:**
   - **Objective:** Develop a user-friendly web application allowing users to input relevant details and receive estimated resale prices.
   - **Rationale:** Create an accessible platform for users to interact with the predictive model seamlessly, enhancing user experience and facilitating informed decision-making.

5. **Continuous Improvement:**
   - **Objective:** Implement mechanisms for ongoing model refinement based on user feedback and evolving market dynamics.
   - **Rationale:** The dynamic nature of the housing market requires continuous adaptation. Regular updates and improvements to the model will ensure its relevance over time.
